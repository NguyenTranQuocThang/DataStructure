QuickSort
Like MergeSort, QuickSort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. We need to pick a pivot, then sort both sublists that are created on either side of the pivot. Similar to the video, we'll follow the convention of picking the last element as the pivot.

Start with our unordered list of items:

items = [8, 3, 1, 7, 0, 10, 2]
Let's sketch out what a first iteration would look like.

We can use len to grab the pivot value, but in order to sort in-place we'll also want the index of the pivot.

# select the last element as the pivot
pivot_index = len(items) - 1
pivot_value = items[pivot_index]
Because we plan on sorting in-place, we want to iterate through the items to the left of our pivot (left_items). When they're larger than pivot_value though, we will not increment our position through left_items, but instead change pivot_index. We'll know we're done with this pass when pivot_index and left_items index are equal.

left_index
left_index = 0
​
while (pivot_index != left_index):
    
    item = items[left_index]
    
    if item <= pivot_value:
        left_index += 1
        continue
    
    # Place the item before the pivot at left_index
    items[left_index] = items[pivot_index - 1]
    # Shift pivot one to the left
    items[pivot_index - 1] = pivot_value
    # Place item at pivot's previous location
    items[pivot_index] = item
    # Update pivot_index
    pivot_index -= 1
​
print(items)
        
You should see:

[0, 1, 2, 7, 3, 10, 8]
When our loop terminated, we knew everything to the left of our pivot was less than pivot, and everything to the right of our pivot was greater than pivot. Great! Now we need to do that again for the sublists that are left and right of pivot's final location.

We can do that by abstracting our above code to a function, just passing the list of items as a parameter.

def sort_a_little_bit(items):
    left_index = 0
    pivot_index = len(items) - 1
    pivot_value = items[pivot_index]
​
    while (pivot_index != left_index):
​
        item = items[left_index]
​
        if item <= pivot_value:
            left_index += 1
            continue
​
        items[left_index] = items[pivot_index - 1]
        items[pivot_index - 1] = pivot_value
        items[pivot_index] = item
        pivot_index -= 1
        
items = [8, 3, 1, 7, 0, 10, 2]
sort_a_little_bit(items)
print(items)
Now what would it require to recurse on this? We want to take the result of that iteration and act on it. So first off, we see that in order to call the function again, we need to communicate the final pivot_index value. And then with that, we can mark off segments of the list and have our function operate on less than the entire list. So let's change our function to accept the indices it should stay within, and return the pivot_index.

def sort_a_little_bit(items, begin_index, end_index):    
    left_index = begin_index
    pivot_index = end_index
    pivot_value = items[pivot_index]
​
    while (pivot_index != left_index):
​
        item = items[left_index]
​
        if item <= pivot_value:
            left_index += 1
            continue
​
        items[left_index] = items[pivot_index - 1]
        items[pivot_index - 1] = pivot_value
        items[pivot_index] = item
        pivot_index -= 1
    
    return pivot_index
​
items = [8, 3, 1, 7, 0, 10, 2]
pivot_index = sort_a_little_bit(items, 0, len(items) - 1)
print(items)
print('pivot index %d' % pivot_index)
Almost there! Let's create another function, the recursive function we want, that uses this. And then we'll have our top level definition of quicksort call it with our initial parameters. But we need a way to know if we're done! We'll use the indices to see if they demark a list of more than one item. If the demarked sublist is 0 or 1 item, we know it's already sorted.

def sort_all(items, begin_index, end_index):
    if end_index <= begin_index:
        return
    
    pivot_index = sort_a_little_bit(items, begin_index, end_index)
    sort_all(items, begin_index, pivot_index - 1)
    sort_all(items, pivot_index + 1, end_index)
    
def quicksort(items):
    sort_all(items, 0, len(items) - 1)
    
items = [8, 3, 1, 7, 0, 10, 2]
quicksort(items)
print(items)
​
It's a good idea to test a few more scenarios. Does it work with an even number of items? What if they're already sorted?

items = [1, 0]
quicksort(items)
print(items)
​
items = [96, 97, 98]
quicksort(items)
print(items)
Mission Accomplished!

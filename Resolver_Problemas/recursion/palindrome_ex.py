# A palindrome is a word that is the reverse of itselfâ€”that is, it is the same word when read forwards and backwards.

# For example:

# "madam" is a palindrome
# "abba" is a palindrome
# "cat" is not
# "a" is a trivial case of a palindrome
# The goal of this exercise is to use recursion to write a function is_palindrome that takes a string as input and checks whether that string is a palindrome. (Note that this problem can also be solved with a non-recursive solution, but that's not the point of this exercise.)

def is_palindrome(input):
    """
    Return True if input is palindrome, False otherwise.

    Args:
       input(str): input to be checked if it is palindrome
    """

    # TODO: Write your recursive palindrome checker here

    # pass
    if len(input) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        first = input[0]
        last = input[-1]
        sub_list = input[1:-1]
        return first == last and is_palindrome(sub_list)
